# Enterprise Architecture Maturity for LLM Systems

Comprehensive maturity assessment framework for enterprise LLM architectures, aligned with industry standards including TOGAF, COBIT, ITIL, and CMMI.

## TL;DR

Not sure where your LLM architecture stands? This framework helps you assess maturity across 7 dimensions and gives you a roadmap to improve. We've aligned it with TOGAF, COBIT, ITIL, and CMMI so you can speak the same language as your enterprise architecture team.

**Key Takeaways**:
- Most organizations start at Level 1-2 - that's normal
- Level 3 is where things get production-ready
- Level 4-5 is for large enterprises and regulated industries
- This is a journey - plan for 12-24 months to reach higher levels
- Focus on one dimension at a time - don't try to do everything at once

## Overview

This framework gives you a structured way to assess where your LLM architecture is today and where you want it to be. We cover architecture governance, technology standards, operational excellence, and business alignment. We've aligned it with industry standards (TOGAF, COBIT, ITIL, CMMI) so it fits into your existing maturity assessments.

## LLM Architecture Maturity Framework

### Dimension 1: Architecture Governance

#### Level 1: Initial
This is where most teams start - and that's okay. You're making decisions ad-hoc, documentation is limited, and there's no formal review process. The important thing is recognizing where you are so you can improve.

#### Level 2: Managed
You've got basic governance in place. Architecture decisions are documented (even if informally), and you have some standards. This is a solid foundation - most teams can operate here for a while.

#### Level 3: Defined
Now you're getting serious. Formal governance, an architecture review board, standardized processes, and defined principles. This is where most production systems should be.

#### Level 4: Quantitatively Managed
You're measuring everything. Metrics, KPIs, continuous improvement - you know exactly where you stand and where you're going. This is enterprise-grade.

#### Level 5: Optimizing
You're not just managing - you're innovating. Continuous optimization, experimentation, best practice sharing. This is where the best organizations operate.
