# Awesome LLM Tools for Enterprise

A curated list of Large Language Model (LLM) tools, frameworks, and platforms specifically focused on enterprise deployment. We've focused on what actually matters in production: security, scalability, compliance, and making sure things don't break at 3 AM.

## 🎯 Project Status & Goals

**This is a community-driven project** to build a practical knowledge base and reference point for enterprise LLM architects. 

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **Partially verified**: Some tools and architectures have been tested in production environments
- 🔄 **In progress**: Many tools and architectures are being validated by the community
- 📝 **LLM-generated foundation**: Portions of the content were generated by LLMs to provide a starting framework for practical validation

**Our Goal:** Together, we're building a comprehensive, practical knowledge base that serves as a reference point for architects designing corporate LLM solutions. This repository is meant to be a living document that improves through community contributions, real-world testing, and shared experiences.

**We need your help!** If you've deployed any of these tools or architectures in production, please share your experiences, challenges, and improvements. Every contribution makes this resource more valuable for the entire community.

## 🎯 What We Focus On

When we say "enterprise-grade," we mean it. Every solution here addresses:

- **Security**: Because one breach can kill your company. We cover authentication, authorization, data protection, and threat modeling.
- **Scalability**: Your system needs to handle 10 users today and 10,000 tomorrow. High availability, load balancing, auto-scaling, multi-tenancy - it's all here.
- **Compliance**: GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA - we've mapped out what you need for each. No guessing.
- **Observability**: When things break (and they will), you need to know why. Monitoring, logging, tracing, alerting - the full stack.
- **Integration**: Your LLM needs to work with your existing systems. SSO, directory services, API gateways - we've got you covered.
- **Data Privacy**: PII handling, data redaction, encryption - because your customers' data is your responsibility.

## 🔧 Open Source Tools

See [open-source-tools.md](./open-source-tools.md) for a comprehensive list of open-source LLM tools. **Note**: Enterprise readiness assessments are based on available documentation, community feedback, and production deployments where available. Some tools (like Qdrant) have known limitations - we document what we know and what needs additional validation.

## 💼 Commercial/Paid Tools

See [commercial-tools.md](./commercial-tools.md) for enterprise-grade commercial LLM platforms and services.

## 🏗️ Reference Architectures

See [reference-architectures/](./reference-architectures/) for detailed implementation guides. Each architecture includes:
- **TL;DR** - Quick summary and assessment
- **Common Issues** - What usually goes wrong and how to fix it
- **Security Recommendations** - Tailored by organization size and data classification
- **Real Examples** - Actual configurations and code snippets
